"As a senior engineer with Nike’s Air Manufacturing Innovation (Air MI) team, Kristina Nardoni is sworn to secrecy. That’s because she’s at the forefront of Air Bag manufacturing that will appear on Nike’s newest shoes, like the ones you’ll see this summer.

She started at Nike in 2017. Previously, her jobs had been in process engineering related to high-voltage equipment. A mentor told her about an opening for a Nike industrial engineering position out of the Air MI facility in Saint Charles, MO. Seven years later, she is using her experience to help launch new products and continue to improve Air Bags that have been beloved for years.

“Industrial engineers are working from a zoomed-out place thinking about a system at large,” says Nardoni. “Some people are most concerned about the Air Bag being used. Others are interested in the machines. We get to look the whole system. One example was when we modified a machine on the floor that was giving operators shoulder pain. We saw the problem and saw that the shoulder pain was symptomatic of something else.”

Nardoni’s deep look at the whole system is also her filter for seeing the holistic development of her own skills. Through Nike’s tuition reimbursement program, Krissy is earning her master's degree in management. She's taking a class at a time, and if she earns an A or a B, she gets reimbursed for the class. “I’m paying just a couple hundred bucks a year to get my master’s degree when it could be costing me thousands,” she says.

Krissy has added to her Nike experience in more ways than just her rising job title. She also served as executive chairwoman of the Women of Nike (WON) employee network. She brought her zoomed-out POV to the position. For example, WON wanted to provide a delicious lunch to Air MI employees who worked nontraditional schedules. So, the team celebrated a midnight cookout together.

Her advice to Nike employees: Learn as much as you can. Take advantage of the learning programs that are offered at the company. Be a sponge. “If you see a maintenance technician fixing a chiller at your workplace, ask what they’re working on,” she says. “You never know what you might learn.”","1425","53"
